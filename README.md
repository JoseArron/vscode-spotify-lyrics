A VSCode extension that displays the lyrics of your currently played song on Spotify!

The app is in development mode, so ...

> Up to 25 authenticated Spotify users can use an app that is in development mode â€” so you can share your app with beta testers, friends, or with fellow developers who are working on the app. Each Spotify user who installs your app will need to be added to your app's allowlist before they can use it.

I have to manually add you to the allowlist before you can use the app.

For now, if you still want to use the extension, you can [send me the email](mailto:ircet.qui@gmail.com) you use for your Spotify account so I can add you to the allowlist <br> ...or you can fork this repo, start a project in Spotify's dev console, replace the client secret with yours, and use it as a local VSCode extension.
